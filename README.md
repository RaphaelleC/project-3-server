MontVenture is an app for all nature enjoyers to publish their favourite spots for hiking, cycling, snowboarding and more.<br>
This is the first project where I have had to create a server connected to a client. It was also the first time I used Git with a group (merging, resolving conflicts).

## Project Brief

* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.

## Approach

We started by designed a quick flowchart of our website. Being able to see how our app was going to look like helped us defining everything we needed to implement in the back end.

Here are our flowcharts:

![Flowchart_1](./screenshots/Flowchart_1.png)
![Flowchart_2](./screenshots/Flowchart_2.png)
![Flowchart_3](./screenshots/Flowchart_3.png)

We've kept a great communication during this project, be it via video calls or through slack. That way, everyone knew what to do and we were all helping each other when facing issues and debugging.

## Responsibilities

### Back end

#### User seeding

I took care of seeding the base users with mongoose and express.

User example :
```javascript
{
  email: 'raph@email',
  username: 'Raph',
  location: 'United Kingdom',
  favSeason: 'Winter',
  password: '****',
  passwordConfirmation: '****',
}
```
The seeding function :
```javascript
async function seedDatabase() {
  try {
    await connectToDb()
    console.log('Successfully connected to mongo !')

    await mongoose.connection.db.dropDatabase()
    console.log('Removed all the activities !')

    const users = await User.create(userData)
    console.log(`${users.length} user(s) created !`)
    console.log(users)
    
    (...)

    await mongoose.connection.close()
    console.log('Disconnected from mongo. All done !')
    
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('Something went wrong :(')
    await mongoose.connection.close()
  }
}
```

#### User controllers

I created the register and login controllers so our users could have an account and post their favourites destinations on our website.

Register controller :
```javascript
async function register(req, res, next) {
  try {
    const user = await User.create(req.body)
    res.status(201).json(user)
  } catch (e) {
    next(e)
  }
}
```

Login controller :
```javascript
async function login(req, res, next) {
  try {
    const user = await User.findOne({ email: req.body.email })

    if (!user) {
      throw new NotValid('There was a problem logging in')
    }
    const isValidPw = user.validatePassword(req.body.password)
    if (!isValidPw) {
      throw new NotValid('There was a problem logging in')
    }

    const token = jwt.sign(
      { sub: user._id },
      secret,
      { expiresIn: '12h' }
    )

    console.log('Success!')
    res.status(202).json({ message: 'Login successful', token })

  } catch (e) {
    next(e)
  }
}
```

### Front end

#### Forms

##### Register and Login

I took care of the registration and login forms, using the `useHistory()` from `react-router-dom` to direct users to the login page after registration, and to the home page after they are logged in.

For the register form :
``` javascript
const history = useHistory()
  const { formdata, formErrors, handleChange, setFormErrors } = useForm({
    username: '',
    email: '',
    location: '',
    favSeason: '',
    password: '',
    passwordConfirmation: '',
  })

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()

    try {
      await registerUser(formdata)
      history.push('/login')
    } catch (err) {
      setFormErrors(err.response.data.errors)
    }
  }
```

For the login form :
```javascript
const history = useHistory()
  const [isError, setIsError] = React.useState(false)
  const { formdata, handleChange } = useForm({
    email: '',
    password: '',
  })

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()

    try {
      const res = await loginUser(formdata)
      setToken(res.data.token)
      history.push('/')
    } catch (err) {
      setIsError(true)
    }
  }
  const handleFocus = () => {
    setIsError(false)
  }
```

##### Edit activity

I also took care of the edit form of our app. We implemented it so our users can update the different activities they created, be it because they made a mistake when creating it or because it changed compared to their previous experience.<br>
I have used `useHistory()` again to redirect the user to the activity page after editing it.

```javascript
React.useEffect(() => {
    const getData = async () => {
      try {
        const res = await getSingleActivity(activityId)
        setFormdata(res.data)
      } catch (e) {
        setFormErrors(e.response.data.errors)
      }
    }
    getData()
  }, [activityId, setFormdata, setFormErrors])

  const handleSubmit = async (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()

    try {
      const { data } = await editActivity(activityId, formdata)
      history.push(`/activities/${data._id}`)
    } catch (e) {
      setFormErrors(e.response.data.errors)
    }
  }
```

#### Styling

![Register_page](./screenshots/Register.png)

Using the Bulma library and CSS, I styled the navigation bar, the register and login forms, as well as the activity pages. We wanted to keep the styling simple so it could better highlight the pictures of the activities.

## Key Learnings

* Time management
* Understanding and improvement of my Mongo, Express and React skils
* Team work and communication
* Github usage (commit, pull, merge, resolve conflicts, push)

## Achievements

* Creation of my first full stack app
* Successful usage of the new technologies I learnt during the course

## Challenges

When we were working on the front end of our app, we realised that we needed to modify our activities data. We needed to change what we called `name` by `activityName` for more clarity. But in doing so, we also had to adjust our front end files accordingly, which took a bit of time. This really made us aware that a little change in the back end implies that we have to spend more time doing changes, time that could be used elsewhere. We will pay more attention to this in future projects.<br>

There is a bug left on our app which we didn't have time to fix : when a user posts a comment, it is posted twice instead of once.

## Conclusions

This project helped me better understand the relationships between the front end and the back end of an app. It also taught me that planning up ahead is really important : making changes on the back end after starting coding the front end is not always easy, we can end up losing time updating things that we thought were done.<br>
It also showed me that time management and making a list of priorities is really important. One of our stretch goals was to implement Mapbox on our app so when a user creates an activity, he could locate it on a map and it would show the location of the activity on its page. We didn't implement that though, as we didn't have enough time left and preferred to focus on refactoring, testing and making sure our app was working properly.
